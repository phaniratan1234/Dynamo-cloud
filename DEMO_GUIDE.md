# 🚀 DYNAMO Model Demo Guide

## How to Run Inference

### 🤖 Smart Routing (Recommended)
DYNAMO's key feature is **automatic task detection** - users just type natural queries!

```bash
# Interactive mode - just type queries!
python inference.py

# Single query
python inference.py --query "This movie is amazing!"

# Batch processing
python inference.py --mode batch --input queries.txt --output results.json
```

### 💡 Example Interactions
```
🔤 Query: This movie was absolutely fantastic!
🤖 DYNAMO Router Decision: sentiment (confidence: 0.892)
📊 Results:
   Prediction: Positive (confidence: 0.945)
   🤖 Router decision: sentiment (0.892)
   📊 All task scores:
     👑 sentiment: 0.892
        qa: 0.034
        summarization: 0.028
        code_generation: 0.024
        translation: 0.022

🔤 Query: What is machine learning?
🤖 DYNAMO Router Decision: qa (confidence: 0.756)
📊 Results:
   Prediction: Machine learning is a method of data analysis...
```

### 🎯 Force Specific Task (For Testing)
```bash
# Override smart routing for comparison
python inference.py --query "Great movie!" --force-task sentiment
```

### 🎮 Quick Demo
```bash
# Run pre-built examples showcasing smart routing
python demo_examples.py
```
